# EasyMeet

## Installation and usage
The repo requires specific environment variables in order to work. Visit the team google drive and open a file called "logins". This file contains all the variables needed, without them, you would be unable to trigger the build.
Use the following command in your desired location:
```
git clone https://github.com/cs130-w21/17
```
Always run:
```
git pull
```
This command ensures that you have the latest version available, though it is unlikely that there will be newer versions from this point on.
